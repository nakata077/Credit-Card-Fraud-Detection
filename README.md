# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project aims to develop a model for detecting fraudulent transactions made by users utilizing credit cards

Data set

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

In this project, I build models using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions. The classification outputs of these models are then utilized as new features for a Random Forest model. I have achieved an accuracy rate of 99%
